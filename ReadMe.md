# Python Based Search-Engine
<h1> What is it? </h1>
Dependencies:
    Python ,NLTK and Scikitlearn
    Collections , Time Module , Pandas , Numpy , ElasticSearch


<p> A full text search engine to retrieve from NLP News Archives, built from scratch using Python ,NLTK and Scikitlearn</p>
<p> The main functionality is in MAIN_FINAL.py file , which takes in input as a collection of CSV Docs</p>
<p> we compared it with results from ElasticSearch.py file </p>


<h1> How to use it?</h1>
<ul>
We have built and designed a search engine in Python that is capable of searching
through a corpus of documents, computing cosine similarities to obtain relevant documents
based on the query, followed by tf-idf scoring based ranking of the results , handling a
single index, and supporting a combination of and/or boolean queries.
Given the 418 Documents as input, we obtain the top 10 relevant document results along
with various column values from the documents such as ‘URL’, ‘MatchDateTime’,
‘Station’, ‘Show’, ‘IAShowID’, ‘IAPreviewThumb’, ‘Snippet’ are returned.
